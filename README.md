# ErrorHandlingContract

This contract demonstrates error handling mechanisms in Solidity, including the `require`, `assert`, and `revert` statements.

## Usage

The `ErrorHandlingContract` allows users to set and retrieve a value, perform an assertion, and trigger a revert based on certain conditions.

### Setting a Value

#### `setValue(uint256 _value) external`

Sets the contract's `value` to the specified `_value` parameter. The function includes a `require` statement to ensure that the value is greater than 0.

**Parameters:**
- `_value`: The value to be set.


### Performing an Assertion

#### `checkAssert() external pure`

Performs an assertion by comparing two values. This function uses the `assert` statement to verify that the value of variable `a` is greater than the value of variable `b`. If the assertion fails, it will throw an error.

### Performing a Revert

#### `checkRevert() external pure`

Performs a revert based on a condition. This function compares the values of variables `a` and `b` and triggers a revert with a custom error message if `a` is less than `b`.

## Error Handling Mechanisms

### `require` Statement

The `require` statement is used to validate conditions that must be true for a function to execute successfully. If the condition evaluates to `false`, the transaction will be reverted, and an error message will be provided. In this contract, the `setValue` function uses a `require` statement to ensure that the specified value is greater than 0.

### `assert` Statement

The `assert` statement is used to verify conditions that should never be false. If the condition evaluates to `false`, it indicates an internal error, and the transaction will be reverted. In this contract, the `performAssertion` function uses an `assert` statement to check if `a` is greater than `b`.

### `revert` Statement

The `revert` statement is used to revert the changes made in the current transaction and provide an error message. It can be triggered by specific conditions, and the error message can be customized. In this contract, the `performRevert` function compares `a` and `b` and triggers a revert with the error message "A is less than B" if `a` is less than `b`.
